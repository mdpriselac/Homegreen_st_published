Our goal is straightforward: make it easy to find and compare green coffees for sale in the USA. Below you will find a description of what you can find and here.

### A single list

We've scoured the internet and most of the reputable green sellers in the USA to put together a list of all green coffees currently for sale from these sellers. The list is available via the All Green Coffees option in the navigation bar to the left. You can sort coffees there by origin, seller, and whether or not the coffee is still for sale. Shortly you'll be able to sort by arrival date as well. You can find a list of which sellers we're following in the about our data collection tab above.

### Overall Data on New Arrivals

In the Fresh Arrival tab you can see which origins are currently popping up on green seller websites. This aggegated information can give us info about which countries are delivering more fresh coffees than usual and so some insight into which coffees from which sellers are likely to be fresher than others.

### Individual Coffee

You can acess individual coffees for sale through the Individual Coffee Information page. When browsing the full data set in All Green Coffees you can select a coffee and go to the individual page with further details about the coffee. Each individual coffee page also has a dynamically generated flavor wheel that goes along with it which is based on the flavor notes from the green seller. We'll soon be adding a section to each individual coffee page that shows the 5 most similar coffees based on location and flavor ntoes.

### Quality Estimates

In this About section of the site you can find lots of information about how we're collecting, processing and using data from green seller websites. We're trying our best to standardize and make uniform the very diverse information that sellers put on their websites. Depending on the information category, we're using a range of tools from LLMs, to simple natural language processing metrics, to simpler processing elemnts. Read more about that in the About our Data Processing tab abvove. 

Once the data is homogenized we're having some fun with it that you may or may not find interesting. We've trained a very basic model to predict Coffee Review ratings based on country of origin and flavor notes. With that model in hand we can look at some aggeregate data about our coffees for sale, like which origins are likelier to produce higher rating coffees, which flavor notes are more closely associated with higher ratings, etc. In service of that we've also adapted the SCAA flavor wheel to be a bit more friendly for our LLM and prediction tools to work with. You can find more information above.

Over time we'll build our models up to take into account more detailed information about coffees like growing elevation and varietals.
