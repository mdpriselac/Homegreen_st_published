Our flavor wheel is modeled on the SCAA flavor wheel. You can find the version we've modeled ours on below.

We've made a few changes to make our flavor wheel play a bit more nicely with our goals of homegenizing flavor descriptions.

As we think of the flavor wheel taxonomy, the outer most circle of flavors are flavor species, the middle ring are flavor genuses, and the inner most ring are flavor families. To make our flavor wheel work better with our data processing we've made the following changes:

- All flavor genuses have at least one flavor family. For example, on the original flavor wheel, Tobacco is a flavor genus that has no species. We've simply extended added a species to the genus, called Tobacco.
- We've added a few 'generic' species that often appear without further qualification in coffee tasting notes. For example, 'Berry' or 'Citrus' are often left without clarification. To give each of those kinds of descriptions a further home in the taxonomy, we've added 'Generic Citrus' and 'Generic Berry' and other similar cases to make taxonimization more complete.
