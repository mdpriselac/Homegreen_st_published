# Next steps

- Add a way for the overall collection to be added to beyond the initial 50. 

- Make sure similarity matches are for *all* coffees not just the 50 (or however many) that are loaded with the 'all' db. Then we load those new found ones to the the total loaded db.

- set the ttl to 5 days.
